## Before you begin

Before using the Glitter Theme Engine, make sure you have:
   - An unpacked OP1 firmware directory 
   - Selected that unpacked directory in the OP1REpackerGUI file browser
   - Applied any modifications to the firmware BEFORE applying the theme. Apply your theme as the last modification 
   - color selector to get hex colors (e.g., #FF0000)


## Basic Mode Guide

   - Basic mode is perfect for quick theme creation, only allowing you to edit OP-1 Global Colors 


### Getting Started in Basic Mode

1. **Launch OP1REpackerGUI**
   - select an unpacked firmware directory in file browser
   - select Glitter to open the theme engine 
   - The tool opens in Basic mode by default
   
2. *Basic Mode Interface**

   - Bottom row is where you enter your new colors
   - All colors should be in hex format (e.g., #FF0000)
   - Select your saved theme to see an update in preview window
   - As you change themes the bottom row will be updated with the corsponding colors of that theme 


### Creating a Theme in Basic Mode

   - Changes affect all SVGs
   - Remember to set these to your desired colors or they will be saved as default
   - After selecting an SVG file a window will present you the available Element IDs for the selected SVG
   - use these IDs to target specific elements of the SVG 

5. **SVG Element ID Mappings**
   - Specify  color rules for individual SVG elements
   - Add multiple mapping sections to target different SVGs in your theme


### Creating a Theme in Advanced mode 

1. **Set Global OP-1 Colors**

   - Each section can have multiple element mappings
   - Use "Remove SVG Mapping" to delete sections

4. **Save and Apply Theme**
   - Enter theme name and description
   - Click "Save Theme"
   - Once Satisfied click Apply Theme


## Applying your theme!

   - Once your theme has been applied sucessfully, close Glitter and return to the main window
   - Make sure your themed directory is selected in the file browser and select 'Repack'
   - Upload the REpacked OP-1 firmware file to the OP-1 


## Tips & Color References

1. **Tips**
   - Use 6-digit hex codes with hash (#FF0000)
   - Consider contrast and readability
   - We want TE to like us so try to keep the spirit of the OP-1. No color atrocities. ;D
   - Start with global colors in Basic mode
   - Switch to Advanced for fine-tuning
   - Save work regularly
   - Test theme with preview before REpacking OP-1 firmware

2. **Common Color References**
   - #00ed95: green encoder 
   - #ff3a5d: red encoder 
   - #698eff: blue encoder
   - #dfd9ff: white encoder, most dynamic elements use this color (tape, high EQ, changing text)
   - #ffffff: white
   - #aeb1dc: "text" white
   - #9256d7: purple background
   - #4d9eff: alternate, lighter blue
   - #383572: dark purple


## Troubleshooting

1. **Preview Not displaying correctly**
   - Check hex color format
   - Check that a theme has not already been applied to the firmware folder
   - If a theme has already been applied, the preview feature will load the modified SVGs
   - Consider this a feature to toggle between themes instead of defaults... its all how you look at it right! 


2. **Theme Not Saving**
   - Verify theme name is entered
   - Check write permissions on your system
   - Ensure valid colors and Element ID mappings 
  

3. **SVG Not Loading**
   - Verify firmware directory is a fresh, unpacked directory.
   - Verify the firmware directory did not get moved after opening Glitter. 
   - Close the program and reopen glitter, Try reselecting the file again 

4. **Theme Not Applying**
   - Check firmware directory location and filenames
   - Check if SVG files were corrupted 
   - Ensure the firmware does not have a theme applied and modifications have been applied before the theme 
   - Check the .json of the theme you saved and compare it with preview.json for correct format
